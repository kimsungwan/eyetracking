# Required Resources for AI Eye-Tracking SaaS

## Python Libraries
Run the following command to install all necessary libraries:
pip install fastapi uvicorn python-multipart torch torchvision numpy opencv-python pillow jinja2 scipy matplotlib

## AI Model (Saliency Map)
We will use the **SAM (Saliency Attentive Model)** architecture.
You need to download the pre-trained weights.

**Option 1: SAM-ResNet (Recommended)**
- Description: ResNet-based model trained on SALICON dataset.
- Download Link: [Google Drive Link usually provided by authors] (We will attempt to use a public mirror or provide a script)
- Alternative: We will implement a simplified version or use a compatible PyTorch port.

## Datasets (For Training/Evaluation)
If you wish to train or evaluate the model yourself, you need the following datasets.
**Note**: These are NOT required for the SaaS to run if you use pre-trained weights.

1. **SALICON Dataset**
   - Description: Large-scale dataset for saliency prediction.
   - Download: http://salicon.net/challenge-2017/
   - Size: ~3GB

2. **MIT1003**
   - Description: Eye tracking dataset.
   - Download: http://people.csail.mit.edu/tjudd/WherePeopleLook/index.html
